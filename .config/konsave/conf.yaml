# This is the configuration file for konsave.
# Please make sure it follows the correct format for proper working of konsave.
# The format should be:

# save:
#     name:
#         location: "path/to/parent/directory"
#         entries: 
#         # these are files to be backed up. They should be present in the specified location.
#             - file1
#             - file2
# export:
#     # This includes files which will be exported with your profile.
#     # They will not be saved but only be exported and imported.
#     # These may include files like complete icon packs and themes..

# You can use these variables and functions in the locations of different entries:
# $HOME: the home directory
# $PROFILES_DIR: directory where all profiles are saved
# $CONFIG_DIR: refers to "$HOME/.config/"
# $KONSAVE_DIR: the location where all Konsave files are stored ("$CONFIG_DIR/konsave").
# ${ENDS_WITH="text"}: for folders with different names on different computers but their names end with the same thing.
# The best example for this is the ".default-release" folder for firefox.
# ${BEGINS_WITH="text"}: for folders with different names on different computers but their names start with the same thing.

# The following files will be saved in your profiles
save:
    configs:

            # - file1
            # - file2
            # - folder1

    # Here are a few examples of how you can add more stuff to back up
    # firefox:
