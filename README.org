** What Are Dotfiles?

[[./screenshot_1650794523.png]]

Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based System. You can tell that a file is
a dotfile because the name of the file will begin with a period-a dot! The period at the beginning of the filename or directory name
indicates that it is a hidden file or directory. This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience
so that i may quickly access them on new machines or new installs. Also, others may find some of my configuration helpful in
customizing their own dotfiles.

** How To Manage Your Own Dotfiles

There are a hundred ways to manage your dotfiles. Personally, I use the git bare repository method for managing my dotfiles. Here is an article about this method of managing your dotfiles: https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/
