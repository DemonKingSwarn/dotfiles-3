* Caveats
  - Some directories are symlinks to another repository like =.emacs.d= is the symlink for [[https://github.com/demonkingswarn/.emacs.d][.emacs.d]], so make sure to check for them.
  - Many of the scripts under =~/.scripts= require =readline= with =-f= available, which is not necessarily available on *BSD/Plan9/MacOS/Alpine.
    This is used to set =SCRIPT_DIR=, which allows scripts to be called from anywhere, as symlinks or otherwise, while retaining functionality.
